# Goal

Goal of the DelugeFirmware community is to produce high quality firmware application releases for users of the Deluge hardware with improvements and new features coming from our community of contributors. To be as transparent and inclusive as possible [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) have been defined with the intent to help reach this goal. Please also see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


# Development strategy

In order to give everyone in the project clear expecatations and transparency on what is going on all development is organized in the form of Pull requests. This ensures visibility on the ongoing activities and prevents intransparent internal changes from disrupting community work on Pull request. 

There is no official roamdap or project activities, instead all contirbutors are welcome to participate in the discussion and planning process as outlined in the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). Members of the community can build informal working groups to achieve greater goals and work on them in the form of collaborative Pull requests.


# Release strategy

There are nightly releases covering all changes of the day as well as stable `community` releases.

`nightly` (beta) releases:
* All incoming changes come from merging Pull requests from the community during the day.
* Every night a new `nightly` firmware will be generated and published on GitHub Releases tagged as `nightly` to allow users to test them.
* The project management team will decide on the right time to pick a promising beta firmware to be a release candidate.

`community` (stable) releases:
* Before a firmware can be released as official community version it must have been released and published in the Github Releases as release candidate (`rc`) for at least two weeks, giving users and developers the chance to thoroughly test them and give feedback.
* Only if the project management team has the feeling that the firmware is stable and delivers a better experience than the previous firmware it is released as an official new `community` release in the Github Releases. 

# What to expect and when to expect it

The project is a community effort of mostly volunteers that define the pace of development with their generous contributions. This means that both the features that are contributed and the timelines can not be known in advance. The nightly releases should ensure that everyone can test the latest and greatest of what has been achieved as soon as possible (please backup your files before starting any testing). There is also always the possibility to contribute to the project yourself, see the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
